# X-RAY_BodyParts_Predictor

I was practicing some of the techniques of Computer Vision and wondering how I was gonna grasp these on my hands. So I started finding interesting DataSets where I can
work on these CV Techniques I Found a fabulous Problem which was to detect the multiple positions from X-ray body parts, like chest, skull, Abdomen, Ankle, etc. 
The images were rough and heavy DNN Models can't predict these body parts with good accuracy, which means it needed some kind of filteration first. like normalization, tiling, and some others.
After Some techniques and data augmentation, I finally completed the work of this task by creating a CNN Model to accurately predict the X-ray body Parts.

That Was Fun!!

Here are the Sample Results:
